## About

This is the Shiny App for the digital humanities edition of *Moby-Dick*.

## Installation:

MacOS and Windows:

1.	Go to http://cran.revolutionanalytics.com/
2.	Follow “Download R for (Mac) OS X” or “Download R for Windows” and download R-3.5.1 or later.
3.	Once downloaded, follow the instructions of the installer to install R on your computer.
4.	Go to my Github repository: https://github.com/kevin931/Moby-Dick
5.	Find “Clone or download,” and choose the “Download ZIP” option.
6.	The downloaded file should be called unessay-master.zip in your default download folder, and unzip the folder in your desired location.
7.	Make sure that all the unzipped files are situated in the same directory (folder) to ensure that the app will work properly.
8.	Launch the R console from your Launchpad for Mac or the start menu for Windows.
9.	For the first time you run the program, run the installer by dragging the file “installer.R” into the console and hit the “enter” key. If prompted, type “y” or select “yes” to continue installation of required packages.
10.	To launch the program, enetr the following command:

'''r

  shiny::runGitHub(“kevin931/Moby-Dick”)

'''

11.	On subsequent launches, repeat step 10.
12.	There will be subsequent updates to the app on my Github page, and re-running the installer will be recommended at that time to update existing packages and acquire new packages.
13.	If you have encountered any questions or issues, please reach out to me via kevinwang@smu.edu.
